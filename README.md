## Challenges
#### CSS styling choices
Using `column-count` to style the PictureCards worked great to have the intended masonry effect I was going for. However, when I only had a few `PictureCards` they would fill as they CSS intended but now how I wanted to have them fill which was a row first display.

## Site Design
